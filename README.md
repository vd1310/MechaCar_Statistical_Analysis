# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: the purpose is to create visualizations to show:
###### 

## Results: 
### D1: Delieverable 1
#### D1.1: The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe

#### D1.2: RScript for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables 
lm_mcar<-lm(mpg~vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD,data=MechaCar_df)

#### D1.3: RScript for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables 
summary(lm_mcar)

### D1.4: Summary:
#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
